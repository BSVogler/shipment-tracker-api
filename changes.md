Changes I added over the basic claude solution:
- dependency management with uv for fast build speed
- dockerfile
- gitlab CI
- use builtins over types
- refactor some functions
- async redis
- 2-tier cache order changes to load local variables first
- run performance test at 300/s
- hypercorn over gunicorn as hypercorn had memory leaks in the past and hypercorn supports http2
- fastapi changed from flask
- versioning for documentation, health endpoint without versioning (e.g. for k8s)
